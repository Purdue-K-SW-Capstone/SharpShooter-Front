Research Problem Statement:
Given the history of consumer experiences, it is difficult to select the best apples in terms of the sugar level or sweetness. In addition, It is challenging for farmers to predict the optimal harvesting time based only on their past experience.

Research Novelty: 
To solve this problem this research aims to develop two different types of models. One is a Machine Learning(ML) model trained using the color, diameter, and the grey scale of apples. The other is a Deep Learning(DL) model which uses images of apples. Both models will give a numerical Brix value as an output. The predictions will then be used to give an estimate of how sweet an apple is. While previous research aimed to find just one model from either ML or DL, The purpose of this research is to use ML and DL to predict apple sweetness in a non-destructive manner. It aims to develop two different models from ML and DL each to increase the prediction accuracy of apple sugar levels.

Environment setting briefly:
We will write about this after we succeed building an accurate model.
